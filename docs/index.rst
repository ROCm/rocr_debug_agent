ROCdebug-agent documentation
==============================

The ROCm Debug Agent (ROCdebug-agent) is a library that can be loaded by the ROCm software runtime (ROCr) to provide the following functionalities:

- Print the state of all AMDGPU wavefronts that cause a queue error (such as, a memory violation, executing a ``s_trap 2``, or executing an illegal instruction).

- Print the state of all AMDGPU wavefronts by sending a SIGQUIT signal to the process using ``kill -s SIGQUIT <pid>`` command or by pressing ``Ctrl-\``, while the program is executing.

This functionality is provided for all AMDGPUs supported by the ROCm Debugger API Library (ROCdbgapi).

You can access ROCdebug-agent code on our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/ROCm/rocr_debug_agent>`_.
